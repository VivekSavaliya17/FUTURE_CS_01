# FUTURE_CS_01
🔐 Web Application Vulnerability Assessment using OWASP Juice Shop &amp; DVWA. Identified SQLi, XSS, IDOR &amp; Insecure FTP via OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite &amp; Nikto. Includes OWASP Top 10 mapping, PoC, impact analysis &amp; mitigation with a professional client-ready security report.

The objective of this project was to simulate a real-world security assessment engagement, identify exploitable vulnerabilities, and produce a professional client-ready report mapped to the OWASP Top 10.

🚀 Tools Used
OWASP ZAP – Automated vulnerability scanning

Burp Suite (Community Edition) – Manual exploitation and interception

Nikto – Web server misconfiguration scanning

Kali Linux – Security testing environment

🔑 Key Features
✔ Identification of 4 high-severity vulnerabilities:

SQL Injection (SQLi) – Login bypass via malicious queries

Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) – JavaScript injection in browser

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) – Unauthorized access to resources

Insecure FTP Service – Anonymous login & sensitive file exposure

✔ Proof-of-Concept (PoC) with screenshots
✔ Risk ratings & impact analysis
✔ Mitigation steps for each vulnerability
✔ OWASP Top 10 mapping & compliance checklist
✔ Professional Security Assessment Report (DOCX/PDF) deliverable

📂 Deliverables
Security Report: Detailed findings, PoC, risk levels, mitigations

OWASP Top 10 Mapping: Aligns vulnerabilities with global standards

Risk Rating Table: Severity-based prioritization

🎯 Outcome
This project demonstrates practical skills in:

Web application penetration testing

Threat modeling & OWASP Top 10 mapping

Security documentation & client reporting

It serves as a comprehensive example of conducting a vulnerability assessment and producing industry-ready deliverables.
